# Python-API

In this project I used CitiPy, openweathermap API, Pandas, Matplotlib to analyse weather closer to Equator.

- Based on the Latitude Vs Max Temp plot, it is evident that Latitudes in the range -20 to 40 has temperature more than 80F. Northern part of equator is hotter than the southern part of the equator.
- Humidity doesnt seem to have a correlation with Latitudes, as it spread between 20 and 100 across all Latitudes.
- Cloudiness doesnt seem to have a correlation with Latitudes, as it spread between 20 and 100 across all Latitudes.
- Wind Speed at the equator is very less compared to northern/southern latitudes
